        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>

        <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

        <li>4 slices bacon</li>

    <!-- Cooking Instructions -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Add flour, grated Cheddar, parsley, baking powder, garlic powder and salt to a bowl and mix to combine. Add milk and shortening. Use a fork or pastry cutter to cut shortening into dry ingredients until combined.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a cutting board and form into an 8-inch square. Cut into 4 pieces, then transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fry bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon on a plate lined with paper towels; drain any excess grease from the skillet. Add sausage patties; fry, turning occasionally, until no longer pink at the center, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to the skillet and fry or scramble eggs to your taste.</li>
        <li>Slice biscuits open horizontally, and assemble the sandwich, from top to bottom: bottom half of biscuit, egg, Cheddar cheese slice, bacon, and sausage, then finish it with the other biscuit half on top.</li>
    </ol>
