# Odin Recipes Project

Welcome to the **Odin Recipes Project**! This project is part of The Odin Project's Full Stack curriculum, designed to practice and solidify the skills learned so far. In this project, I will be building a basic recipe website where users can browse different recipes and their ingredients.

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a static website that displays a collection of recipes. Each recipe will have:

- A title
- A list of ingredients
- A set of instructions
- A link to view the recipe in detail

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to structure and style a simple website using **HTML** and **CSS**, and it's a great way to improve my skills with basic web development technologies.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have:

- Practiced **HTML** to create structured content.
- Used **CSS** to style and make the page visually appealing.
- Learned how to create simple navigation between different pages.
- Gained experience in organizing and displaying content in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **Homepage** with an overview of all available recipes.
- **Recipe pages** with detailed information including ingredients and instructions.
- **Responsive layout**, ensuring the site is accessible across different screen sizes.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced styling with **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox**.
- Integrate JavaScript for interactive features (like a search bar or filtering recipes).
- Enhance the user experience with a **back-end** to store recipes dynamically (future project goals).

## Reflection

Through this project, I aim to gain confidence in using **HTML** and **CSS** for creating static websites. It will be a step forward in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.
